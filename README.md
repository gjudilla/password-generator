# Password Generator Challenge

## Description

I was given the design elements, HTML and CSS code as well as a few starting functions of JavaScript (provided in UCB Bootcamp Challenge Repository), for a random password generator, made with the intention of producing secure passwords of employees that handle sensitive data. Initially non-functional, I made edits soley to the JavaScript file to create a working password generator that allows the user to create a password between 8 to 128 characters in length at the simple click of a button. The user is able to select from a series of prompts on whether they would like their password to include uppercase or lowercase letters, special characters, and/or numbers. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this password generator, click the 'Generate Password' button on the website. You will be given a series of prompts to help construct your desired password (ie. if you would like your password to contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, or numbers). At least one character set must be chosen to receive a password. Note: passwords must also be 8 to 128 characters in length. If a value was input erroneously or does not satisfy the criteria needed to generate a password, a prompt will appear to correct this error. When all criteria has been satisfied, your randomly generated password will populate.
